Below document provides general overview on Management of ADA Homecare organization.

We as ADA Homecare are data oriented team and we understand data importance to support our business.
Being data providers and data collectors we understand how critical it is to serve our users.

ADA Homecare goal is to provide on time and best quantity data to all Homecare users at any time. 
Our core model was designed to create user friendly IT enviroment for total category.

Below are key elements we took model while designind the model:

1/ All people same data
2/ Deliver P&G quality
3/ Available on each shelf

Those key elements led to creation of **ADA_homecare_core_document** from which we start our data oriented journey.
As we are creating history for Homecare this document had to be written in IT "stone" - we used Excel.

The **ADA_homecare_core_document** provides starting point for all the data used in any ADA Solution (Powerbi, Python, Powerautomate, KNIME) point program using SNH Homecare data.

All my critical updates need to be available shortly after for all.
