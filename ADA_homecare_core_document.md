Dear Citizen Developer,

_Welcome on board and fasten your seatbelt._ 

This document will give you an initial overview on _who we are_ and _how we work_ in _ADA Homecare_ organization.

We as _ADA Homecare_ are **data and customer** oriented team which understands the importance of data that supports our business.
We know who our customers are and where they _"buy"_ to constantly serve them with our products.

**Our mission:** provide on time, best quality and _fit-for-use_ data to all Homecare users. We are committed to developing solutions that enable informed decisions and optimize the balance between _human_ workload and automation. 

We want to achieve this by creating user-friendly IT environment for the entire category. Making it easy for users to focus on analyzing data and solving business problems, rather than spending time searching for or verifying data. At _ADA Homecare_, we are here to ensure that your daily data is of high quality, trusty, and well-governed.

**Our model design was guided by the following essential principles:**

1/ Everyone, all the time, deserves equal access to the same data  
2/ We are here to deliver P&G quality  
3/ We want to be available on each shelf  

Those key elements led to the creation of the **ADA Homecare Core Document**, marking the beginning of our digital transformation journey. You are now becoming an integral part of it. We have embedded our model in IT "engraved stone" which is Excel. We wanted to keep it simple. This _file_ serves as a control panel where we centralize all information, ensuring the **sustainability** of our products. It provides a continuous and synchronized operation of our _multi-chain_, which collects and distributes our data using ADA Solutions and Excel. The **ADA Homecare Core Document** is owned by _ADA Homecare_ B2 and is shared with a limited number of people via the adahomercare.im folder in the _ADA Homecare_ Sharepoint. 

_ADA Solutions_ must meet **iRisk** requirements. To make it simple we do it via EUPSC HOME PowerBI Workspace. Our _core document_ collects all TID's and AED's for connections we operate with. Any new model has to be designed with _ADA Homecare_ team and stored in _core document_ with approved TID/AED provided in **_draw.io_**.  

**data storage location:** EUPSC HOME Workspace (Premium)  
**orchestration tool:** adahomecare.im@pg.com for data governance and quality  

Welcome on board and enjoy the trip!
<br></br>
Your sincere
ADA Homecare team
