<span style="font-size: 5;">Dataflows:</span>

**official** - only queries based on P&G owned sources. Like for example: _ap_financial_shipment.open_orders_ from PS Data Hub

**external not allowed** - if your query is complex and cannot be fully moved to P&G "official" sources you must provide complete technical documentation of your solution. It will be stored for it's governance on our _ADA Solutions_ **SharePoint** owned by _ADA Homecare_ B2.

**refresh frequency:** daily, monthly, weekly, live  
*_disclaimer: for external sources we will require timestamp of last refresh - continuously_

**refresh triggers:** api, powerbi

**Quality** - all our data requires evidence of quality against specified P&G official sources. We will keep continuous check against those sourcse with our PowerAutomate quality schedule.

**correct documentation** is understood as clearly described KNIME flow or any type of code. PowerAutomate flows need to be transferred to adahomrecare.im, KNIME files stored in _adahomecare.im_ folder on Sharepoint 

**query must be provided** mandatory. No dataflow will be created before previous check with ADA team. Your query is stored in P&G GitHub repository under the name: ADA_Homecare. This makes our queries easily accessible by all members of _ADA Homecare_.

_(consider using ChatGPT to provide you with entry description for each step - then YOU review, correct and provide missing details)_  
**DO NOT DISCLOSE ANY CONNECTION DETAILS AND REPLACE _SCHEMA_ NAME WITH SPECIFIC WORD TO EASILY REPLACE AFTERWARDS**

<span style="font-size: 5;">Datamarts:</span>

**single data source for Home Care users** - end user connected to datamart will be able to source all official measures that ADA Team delivers for Homecare category.We provide correct and quality data for any 'recognized' end-point when connected by combination of fpc/dc/time to our masterdata matrix tables.

**single data source for PowerBI reports/dashboards** - direct connect to datamart = synchronized refresh. PowerBI reports/dashboards sourcing from same datamart are being refreshed simultaneously with datamart using minimum capacity. 


 _ADA Core Document_:

Document with description of ADA Home Care organization. Documents "linkage" between all dataflows, datamarts, PowerAutomate workflows and python codes. **A full skeleton**. Excel file allows to orchestrate ADA Solutions in synchronized way. This is a control panel. Has also all the references to GitHub SQL\power queries\python codes (search P&G GitHub looking for names from Excel). We plan to use GitHub to feed our python codes with SQL queries and more to use in Home Care further automations
