<span style="font-size: 5;">Dataflows:</span>

**official** - only queries based on P&G owned tables example: _ap_financial_shipment.open_orders_ from PS Data Hub

**external not allowed** - if your query is complex and cannot be fully moved to datamart you must provide complete technical documentation. It will be stored for it's governance on our _ADA Solutions_ **sharepoint list** owned by _ADA Homecare_ B2.

**refresh frequency:** daily, monthly, weekly, liveb  
*_disclaimer: for external sources we will require timestamp of last refresh - continuously_

**refresh triggers:** api, powerbi

**quality** - all our data requires evidence of quality against specified P&G official sources. We will keep continuous check against those sourcse with our PowerAutomate quality schedule

**correct documentation** is understood as clearly described KNIME flow or any type of code. PowerAutomate flows need to be transferred to adahomrecare.im, KNIME files stored in _adahomecare.im_ folder on Sharepoint 

**query must be provided** mandatory. No dataflow will be created before previous check with ADA team. Your query is stored in P&G GitHub repository under the name: ADA_Homecare. This makes our queries easily accessible by all members of _ADA Homecare_.

_(consider using ChatGPT to provide you with entry description for each step - then YOU responsible to correct or provide details)_  
**DO NOT DISCLOSE ANY CONNECTION DETAILS AND REPLACE _SCHEMA_ NAME WITH SPECIFIC WORD TO EASILY REPLACE AFTERWARDS**

<span style="font-size: 5;">Datamarts:</span>

**contains official measures** - end user connected to datamart will be able to source all official measures that ADA Team delivers for Homecare category.We provide correct and quality data for any 'recognized' end-point when connected by combination of fpc/dc/time to our masterdata matrix tables.

**single point data source for PowerBI reports/dashboards** - direct connect to datamart = synchronized refresh. PowerBI reports/dashboards sourcing from same datamart are being refreshed simultaneously with datamart using minimum capacity. 


Shortly on _Core Document_:

A **full skeleton** is provided. The Excel file allows you to orchestrate your flows, dataflows, datamart and synchronize them. This is a control panel. It contains all the references to GitHub where queries are stored. We use GitHub to feed our python codes with SQL code to use it for further automations.

Welcome on board and enjoy the trip!
